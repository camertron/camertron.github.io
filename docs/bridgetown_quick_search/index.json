          "content": "This article is a response to Jason Swett’s “Beware of ‘service objects’ in Rails” blog post. In it, Jason warns of the dangers of letting service objects rob you of the benefits of object-oriented programming. I’ve read Jason’s post several times, and listened to a number of discussions he’s had about service objects on his podcast, Rails with Jason.\n\nBy the way, both Jason’s blog and podcast are excellent. Go check them out right now 😊\n\nJust last week, Jason was invited onto the Remote Ruby podcast where he and the panelists discussed service objects again. Something about the converstaion struck a cord with me. I’ve listened to Jason talk about his distaste for service objects for a long time. I think he’s right, but also wrong. What follows are my thoughts on the humble, oft misunderstood, service object.\n\nIntro\n\nRails has been around for a long time now. It feels weird to write this, but it’ll be Rails’ 20th birthday in just a few short years. For those of us who’ve used the framework for a long time, 20 years feels like a pretty incredible milestone.\n\nI started using Rails ~11 years ago, pretty much straight out of college. I worked on Twitter’s International Engineering Team on the Twitter Translation Center, a Rails app that managed our large database of localized content and facilitated contributions from thousands of volunteer translators around the world. It was my first time using Ruby, and I absolutely fell in love with it. Ruby and Rails made CakePHP, the framework I was using at the time for my side projects, feel pretty clunky and outmoded. Ruby and Rails are still my favorite language and framework today, and I know many other devs who feel the same way.\n\nWhy has Rails had such staying power? I would argue there are two major reasons:\n\n\n  The Ruby and Rails communities are nonpareil in the software world, and\n  Rails keeps evolving.\n\n\nHotwire is just the latest example of the evolution Rails devs have enjoyed for the last two decades. I invite you to look back on the asset pipeline, action cable, and turbolinks as a few examples from the past that also changed the game.\n\nWe’ve Evolved Too\n\nWhile the framework has changed, so have we as Rails developers. A few years ago much noise was made over the “fat model, skinny controller” concept (in case you’re not familiar, the idea is to keep your controller code to a minimum and put all your domain logic into the model layer).\n\nIn fact, I would posit that a number of the changes in thinking we’ve gone through as a community have been related to code organization. Where do you put that odd piece of code that doesn’t seem to fit in any of Rails’ predefined slots?\n\nOne of the answers is to give Rails new slots:\n\n\n  The draper gem adds the app/decorators directory for “view models,” i.e. view presenters.\n  The form objects design pattern adds the app/forms directory for handling complex forms.\n  The pundit gem adds the app/policies directory for specifying authorization rules.\n  The view_component gem adds the app/components directory for components that encapsulate view code.\n  Etc, etc.\n\n\nOf course Rails itself also adds new slots from time to time:\n\n\n  Rails 3.0 introduced concerns and the app/models/concerns folder for augmenting models.\n  Rails 4.2 introduced active job and the app/jobs folder for background jobs.\n  Also see app/assets, app/channels, etc.\n\n\nWhile all these also added awesome new features to Rails, let’s not overlook how significant it is that they introduced a bunch of additional slots to help us organize our code better. In fact, you’d probably agree that a lot of Rails’ power comes from its predefined folder structure (just ask your favorite React dev 😏).\n\nService Objects\n\nService objects are yet another slot for organizing our Ruby code, albeit a fairly misunderstood one. For instance, although the community has produced a number of gems for creating service objects, we haven’t really coalesced around any one of them. That’s probably because service objects in their purest form are just Ruby classes with a fancy name.\n\nFor example, here’s a service object that creates a user:\n\nclass CreateUser\n  def self.call(params)\n    User.create(params)\n  end\nend\n\n\nNow, I hear you saying, “Wait wait, that’s not what service objects are!” and you’re right. The term “service object” means different things to different people. In my opinion however, here’s what a “service object” is:\n\n\n  A plain ‘ol Ruby object with a call method.\n\n\nThat’s literally it.\n\nOk there is one other thing. You may have noticed that the name of the example service object above, CreateUser, sounds more like the name of a method than a class. That’s intentional.\n\nI like to think of service objects as representing actions.\n\nSkinny Controllers\n\n“Hey,” I hear you saying. “Actions… like in controllers?”\n\nYes! In the applications I’ve worked on, service objects were extracted exclusively from controller actions.\n\nThis is the major point on which Jason and I differ. Whereas he writes about service objects as being part of the models directory, I think of them as being part of the controllers directory. In my mind, “services” are just miniature web applications. Service objects therefore should aid in responding to web requests.\n\nConsider again our humble CreateUser service object. We can easily imagine how the User.create call inside it could have once been part of a controller action:\n\nclass UsersController &lt; ApplicationController\n  def create\n    @user = User.create(user_params)\n\n    if @user.valid?\n      UserMailer.with(user: @user).welcome_email.deliver_later\n      redirect_to dashboard_path, notice: 'Welcome aboard!'\n    else\n      render :new\n    end\n  end\n\n  private\n\n  def user_params\n    params.require(:user).permit(:first_name, :last_name, :email_address)\n  end\nend\n\n\nNotice that the #create action creates the user, but also sends a welcome email.\n\nAs your app grows, so do your controller actions. Maybe you decide you want to register the user with your 3rd-party email/marketing system when they sign up. A few months later you decide to A/B test sending a free trial email at signup instead of the traditional welcome email:\n\nclass UsersController &lt; ApplicationController\n  def create\n    @user = User.create(user_params)\n\n    if @user.valid?\n      BrazeClient.new.register_email(@user.email_address)\n\n      if Flipper.enabled?(:free_trial_email_at_signup, @user)\n        UserMailer.with(user: @user).free_trial_email.deliver_later\n      else\n        UserMailer.with(user: @user).welcome_email.deliver_later\n      end\n\n      redirect_to dashboard_path, notice: 'Welcome aboard!'\n    else\n      render :new\n    end\n  end\n\n  private\n\n  def user_params\n    params.require(:user).permit(:first_name, :last_name, :email_address)\n  end\nend\n\n\nWhoa, that #create method is getting pretty long. More concerning though is how much logic it encapsulates - logic that can’t be reused outside the controller. In addition, I’ve only shown a single action in this example. A complete RESTful controller will have seven.\n\nLet’s pull all that creation code into the service object instead:\n\nclass CreateUser\n  def self.call(params)\n    new(params).create\n  end\n\n  def initialize(params)\n    @params = params\n  end\n\n  def create\n    user.tap do |u|\n      if u.valid?\n        send_email_address_to_braze\n        send_signup_email\n      end\n    end\n  end\n\n  private\n\n  def send_email_address_to_braze\n    BrazeClient.new.register_email(user.email_address)\n  end\n\n  def send_signup_email\n    if send_free_trial_email?\n      UserMailer.with(user: user).free_trial_email.deliver_later\n    else\n      UserMailer.with(user: user).welcome_email.deliver_later\n    end\n  end\n\n  def send_free_trial_email?\n    Flipper.enabled?(:free_trial_email_at_signup, user)\n  end\n\n  def user\n    @user ||= User.create(@params)\n  end\nend\n\n\nI really like this. Not only is the public API minimal, I can hang a bunch of helper methods onto the class that I might have been hesitant to add to the controller.\n\nAnd by extracting the user creation logic into the service object, the controller now does a whole lot less:\n\nclass UsersController &lt; ApplicationController\n  def create\n    @user = CreateUser.(user_params)\n\n    if @user.valid?\n      redirect_to dashboard_path, notice: 'Welcome aboard!'\n    else\n      render :new\n    end\n  end\n\n  private\n\n  def user_params\n    params.require(:user).permit(:first_name, :last_name, :email_address)\n  end\nend\n\n\nBut skinny controllers aren’t the only benefit.\n\nBulk User Importer\n\nIn my mind, the most significant benefit of the service object approach is code reuse.\n\nLet’s say our company starts offering our services b2b and we need to create a bunch of user accounts for all the people who work at another company. We decide to add a bulk user importer to our system that’s capable of reading a CSV file and creating a bunch of user accounts all at once. This exact scenario came up at one of my previous jobs.\n\nFortunately, our user creation logic is conveniently encapsulated into a service object, so reusing it is a piece of cake:\n\nrequire 'csv'\n\nclass UserCsvFile\n  attr_reader :path\n\n  def initialize(path)\n    @path = path\n  end\n\n  def import\n    table.each do |row|\n      CreateUser.(row.to_h)\n    end\n  end\n\n  private\n\n  def table\n    @table ||= CSV.parse(File.read(path), headers: true)\n  end\nend\n\nUserCsvFile.new('/path/to/users.csv').import\n\n\nYou could copy and paste the code from the controller into the UserCsvFile class, but at what cost? Every time the controller changes, so does UserCsvFile. At some point, someone’s gonna forget to update both codepaths.\n\nThat’s… all there is to it?\n\nI’m sure some of you reading this are now thoroughly fed up. Has it really taken this guy over a thousand words just to tell you about Ruby classes?\n\nWell, that’s the thing about service objects. They really can be that simple. In fact, service objects aren’t even a design pattern. They’re just a code organization tool for extracting chunks of procedural code from controller actions, i.e. “do this, then do this, then do this last thing.” The “service object” moniker is just a name. We could easily call these chunks of code “actions” or maybe “commands” as Jason mentions.\n\nLoss of Object-Orientation\n\nIn his blog post, Jason makes the following assertion:\n\n\n  Service objects throw out the fundamental advantages of object-oriented programming.\n\n  “Objects” like this aren’t abstractions of concepts in the domain model. They’re chunks of procedural code masquerading as object-oriented code.\n\n\nHe’s absolutely right that service objects aren’t abstractions of concepts in the domain model. They exist to encapsulate procedural code. After all, controller actions tend to be procedural, so it follows that service objects are as well.\n\nThis encapsulation idea is one of the tenets of object-oriented programming; the data needed to perform the action is held by the object, and the object’s method’s (call in our case) uses that data to perform the action.\n\nAdvanced Techniques\n\nBecause service objects are just classes with basically no rules, you have the full power of the Ruby language at your disposal. Pretty much anything goes.\n\nFor example, consider the various ways our CreateUser operation can fail. Might be kinda nice to support some failure modes:\n\nclass UsersController &lt; ApplicationController\n  def create\n    CreateUser.(user_params) do |result|\n      # creation succeeded\n      result.success do |_user|\n        redirect_to dashboard_path, notice: 'Welcome aboard!'\n      end\n\n      # user is invalid\n      result.failure do |user|\n        @user = user\n        render :new\n      end\n\n      # CreateUser.() raised an error\n      result.error do |e|\n        Rollbar.error(e)\n        flash.now[:error] = 'Something went wrong, please try again'\n        render :new\n      end\n    end\n  end\n\n  private\n\n  def user_params\n    params.require(:user).permit(:first_name, :last_name, :email_address)\n  end\nend\n\n\nDang that’s nice 🔥🔥🔥\n\nHere’s what the service object might look like:\n\nclass CreateUser\n  def self.call(params)\n    new(params).create\n  end\n\n  def initialize(params)\n    @params = params\n  end\n\n  def create\n    if user.valid?\n      send_email_address_to_braze\n      send_signup_email\n      Success.new(user)\n    else\n      Failure.new(user)\n    end\n  rescue Exception =&gt; e\n    Error.new(e)\n  end\n\n  private\n\n  def send_email_address_to_braze\n    BrazeClient.new.register_email(user.email_address)\n  end\n\n  def send_signup_email\n    if send_free_trial_email?\n      UserMailer.with(user: user).free_trial_email.deliver_later\n    else\n      UserMailer.with(user: user).welcome_email.deliver_later\n    end\n  end\n\n  def send_free_trial_email?\n    Flipper.enabled?(:free_trial_email_at_signup, user)\n  end\n\n  def user\n    @user ||= User.create(@params)\n  end\nend\n\n\nAnd finally here are the result classes:\n\nclass Result\n  def initialize(args)\n    @args = args\n  end\n\n  def success(&amp;block); end\n  def failure(&amp;block); end\n  def error(&amp;block); end\nend\n\nclass Success &lt; Result\n  def success(&amp;block)\n    yield *@args\n  end\nend\n\nclass Failure &lt; Result\n  def failure(&amp;block)\n    yield *@args\n  end\nend\n\nclass Error &lt; Result\n  def error(&amp;block)\n    yield *@args\n  end\nend\n\n\nConclusion\n\nI hope this article has explained why service objects deserve a place in your Rails app. Just remember to keep ‘em out of your model code.\n\nDisagree?

          "content": "In this post I respond to another of Jason Swett’s recent articles, Don’t wrap instance variables in attr_reader unless necessary. Jason, if you’re reading this please know this blog isn’t only about critiquing your writing, which I find insightful and thought-provoking. You’ve really gotten me thinking lately, and I’ve been meaning to start a blog for a long time anyway. Seemed like a good opportunity to finally get one going.\n\nWhat is attr_reader?\n\nIt’s common to see Ruby classes expose instance variables using a special class method called attr_reader, eg:\n\nclass Email\n  attr_reader :subject, :body\n\n  def initialize(subject, body)\n    @subject = subject\n    @body = body\n  end\nend\n\nemail = Email.new('Check this out', 'Ruby rocks')\nputs email.subject  # =&gt; prints \"Check this out\"\n\n\nAs you can see, attr_reader :name defines the #name method on our Email class. The #name method simply returns the value of the @name instance variable.\n\nRuby also features two other class methods, attr_writer and attr_accessor. The former defines a method for assigning a value to an instance variable (eg. #name=) while the latter defines both the getter and the setter (i.e. both #name and #name=).\n\nWhy would you ever do this? The basic premise is that instance variables are private, meaning nobody outside the class can get or set them. By wrapping ivars with attr_reader and friends, they are now available to the outside world.\n\nWhy Methods are Almost Always Better\n\nIn my opinion, by far the biggest benefit of attr_reader is that it exposes instance variables as methods. Why are methods better? In a word, inheritance.\n\nThere’s no way to override instance variables in Ruby. Consider an ivar-only version of our Email class from earlier (notice the addition of the #deliver_to method):\n\nrequire 'mail'\n\nclass Email\n  def initialize(subject, body)\n    @subject = subject\n    @body = body\n  end\n\n  def deliver_to(address)\n    mail = Mail.new\n    mail[:from] = 'no-reply@camerondutro.com'\n    mail[:to] = address\n    mail[:subject] = @subject\n    mail[:body] = @body\n    mail.deliver!\n  end\nend\n\n\nLet’s say I want to add a signature at the end of the email body. To do so, I’ll create a new EmailWithSignature class that inherits from Email:\n\nclass EmailWithSignature &lt; Email\nend\n\n\nSomewhere in my new class, I need to append the signature to the body. I only really have two options:\n\n\n  Override #initialize and append the signature to @body.\n  Override #deliver_to so it appends the signature on send.\n\n\nNeither of these options feel particularly “clean.” Both #initialize and #deliver_to accept arguments, and those arguments can change over time. If I override one of them, I have to make sure my derived EmailWithSignature class changes whenever Email does.\n\nIf I choose to override #deliver_to, I have to copy/paste the logic into EmailWithSignature in order to change the content of the body, or potentially reassign @body before calling super. Yuck.\n\nInstead, let’s wrap our instance variables in attr_readers (see above). Now the derived class can simply override the body method, which will always accept zero arguments:\n\nclass EmailWithSignature &lt; Email\n  def body\n    super + \"\\n\\n-Cameron Dutro\\nInternational Man of Mystery\"\n  end\nend\n\n\nMuch easier, much cleaner.\n\nThe limitations of the ivar approach have bitten me numerous times in my professional career. In most cases, requirements had changed and I found myself needing to extend an existing class. Using attr_reader would have given me the “hooks” I needed to non-intrusively modify the class’s behavior.\n\nRemember that derived classes can call your private methods. If you’re worried about someone else messing with your encapsulated data, just make your attr_readers private:\n\nclass Email\n  attr_reader :subject, :body\n  private :subject, :body\n\n  def initialize(subject, body)\n    @subject = subject\n    @body = body\n  end\nend\n\nemail = Email.new('Check this out', 'Ruby rocks')\nputs email.subject  # =&gt; raises a NoMethodError\n\n\nHowever, I prefer to make all of mine public. That’s because I believe encapsulation doesn’t exist.\n\nThe Problem with Encapsulation\n\nIf you’ve gone through any sort of formal computer science training, chances are you’ve been taught the four main pillars of object-oriented programming: inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism, and encapsulation.\n\nAs you probably already know, encapsulation prevents direct access to an object’s state. In Ruby, that means preventing direct access to an object’s instance variables. The idea is that the object and the object alone should be able to mutate its state, perhaps to maintain some invariants, etc.\n\nHowever in the vast majority of object-oriented systems, much of what we think of as the internal, encapsulated state of an object is actually shared state. Let’s take a look at a class (granted, a very naïve one) that represents an email address:\n\nclass EmailAddress\n  def initialize(address)\n    unless address.include?('@')\n      raise InvalidAddressError, \"the address '#{address}' is invalid\"\n    end\n\n    @address = address\n  end\n\n  def user\n    @address.split('@')[0]\n  end\n\n  def host\n    @address.split('@')[1]\n  end\nend\n\n\nOur class nicely encapsulates @address. Nobody else should be able to mess with it right?\n\nWrong!\n\naddress_str = 'foo@bar.com'\naddress = EmailAddress.new(address_str)\naddress.host  # =&gt; \"bar.com\"\naddress_str.replace('woops!')\naddress.host  # =&gt; nil\n\n\nWoops! Since everything in Ruby is passed by reference, it’s entirely possible for the data given to an object to change without the object’s knowledge. In other words, encapsulation can be easily bypassed.\n\nIt doesn’t matter if we use ivars or make the attr_reader private. There’s always the chance someone else is holding on to a reference to our “private” data and can mutate it at will.\n\nTo me, that’s a pretty big deal. It means encapsulation is kind of a lie. If you assign ivars in your class’s constructor from passed-in data, you might as well expose them with attr_readers. They’re basically public anyway.\n\nEncapsulating Better\n\nHold on. If encapsulation doesn’t exist, then doesn’t that call all of object-oriented programming into question?\n\nMaybe, but I’m not the right person to say one way or the other. I happen to really enjoy object-oriented programming. It fits the way my brain works.\n\nBut just like a number of aspects of software development, programming well requires discipline. I posit that large object-oriented systems stay afloat because programmers, mostly unconsciously, develop an understanding of the nuances of encapsulation and evolve habits to avoid the major pitfalls. That’s certainly been the case for me. It was only in thinking deeply about this article that I began to ask myself why, for example, reassigning instance variables feels wrong to me.\n\nTo that end, I like to follow these rules:\n\n\n  Only set instance variables once. After they are set, treat them like constants.\n  Copy objects before mutating them.\n\n\nThe goal here is to prevent our objects from changing except at well-known points in time.\n\nOnly Set Instance Variables Once\n\nIn most cases, I think reassigning instance variables is a code smell. If your object needs to change what data it references, it should have asked for different data at initialization.\n\nNOTE: Methods that use instance variables to memoize the result of a lazily evaluated expression are ok because, although the object didn’t ask for the data at initialization, it still only sets the instance variable once.\n\nThe less your object’s state changes after initialization, the less uncertainty you introduce into the system.\n\nCopy Objects Before Mutating Them\n\nConsider this classic example of pass-by-reference mayhem:\n\ndef compliment(name)\n  puts name &lt;&lt; ', you rock!'\nend\n\nname = 'Cameron'\ncompliment(name)\nname  # =&gt; \"Cameron, you rock!\"\n\n\nThe caller probably isn’t expecting compliment to mutate name.\n\nThe same principle applies to data referenced by an object’s instance variables. Mutating only copies of your data prevents these sorts of surprises.\n\nBack to attr_reader\n\nOk, but what does all this have to do with attr_reader?\n\nIn his usual erudite manner, Jason lays out the case against attr_reader with the following statement:\n\n\n  Adding a public attr_reader throws away the benefits of encapsulation\n\n  Private instance variables are useful for the same reason as private methods: because you know they’re not depended on by outside clients.\n\n  If I have a class that has an instance variable called @price, I know that I can rename that instance variable to @cost or change it to @price_cents (changing the whole meaning of the value) or even kill @price altogether. What I want to do with @price is 100% my business. This is great.\n\n\nHopefully I’ve shown in this article why encapsulation is more or less a myth. There’s no way to know who else may reference the same data as your instance variables, so it very well may not be “100% your business.” This is especially true if one of your methods returns it somehow, perhaps wrapped by another object.\n\nI do agree that adding attr_reader :price changes the class’s public interface, making it more difficult to change in the future. Unless you’re developing library code or a gem however, I think the public interface argument is fairly weak. As Jason says a few paragraphs earlier, if a naming issue causes a problem in your application, your application probably isn’t tested well enough.\n\nConclusion\n\nMy takeaway message is this: encapsulation doesn’t provide the guarantees we were taught it does. There’s no real benefit to “hiding” data inside an object, since that data may be referenced - privately or publicly - by any number of other objects. You might as well expose your instance variables with attr_reader for the inheritance benefits.\n\nDisagree? Hit me up on Twitter."
